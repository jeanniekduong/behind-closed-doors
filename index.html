</div>
		<div>Despite it being a mostly invisible illness, it is estimated that over 600,000 Australians have an issue with compulsive hoarding.

Behind Closed Doors offers insight into the life of a hoarder by showing how they may live, and the reasons behind why they hold onto certain items.

Sarah kindly opened up her home to us. This is a small glimpse into the physical life of a hoarder.

A TALK WITH JEANETTE SILVA FROM THE LIFELINE COMPULSIVE HOARDING TREATMENT PROGRAMEndFragment</div>
		<div>Behind Closed Doors is an online documentary that seeks to give people a glimpse into the hidden world of hoarders by giving them an opportunity to experience the physicality and thought processes experienced by those with this condition. Users can gain a better understanding of how a hoarder lives by exploring their home and listening to a first-hand account from someone dealing with this disorder.
When exploring each room, the scene is personally narrated by a clinical hoarder, Sarah, who explains which room they are in and what is there. The user then has the option to click on a highlighted object. Sarah then explains what the object is and why she is holding on to it. This feature is integral to the projects aim as it attempts to normalise the collection of items as the user will empathise with the hoarder and understand why they keep the object.

It is important for people to realise that compulsive hoarding is often a symptom of another underlying issue, such as depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. In many cases, for people to fully overcome this disorder they have to address these underlying problems first. Behind Closed Doors only scrapes the surface of the world of hoarding and due to the varying nature and causes, every case is different and cannot be generalised. This online documentary aims to be the first step in a better understanding and better treatment of compulsive hoarding.
